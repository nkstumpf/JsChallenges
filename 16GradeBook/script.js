Planning the app

What needs to happen when we push the submit button?

* Create a data structure to store our data that can be organized for averaging grades and different students

1. Event listener

2. Get the value of each input field and store it

3. push data to data stucture

4. we need methods of that data stucture that will return the data we want and update is accordingly

5. get the dom elements where we want to post the data 

6. post the data to the correct dom elements

7. add a 'remove item' button that gets created with the new data

// extra feature ideas: 

// add the ability to add new students to your class and store all their data separately
// add dropdown menu with all the students in your class that when selected would bring up that students scores
// add ability to sort your table by subject or grade
