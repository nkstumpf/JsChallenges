    </ol>
            
    <p>There are 3 parks total and 4 streets and they all have both a name and a build year.</p>
            
    <p>Create a data structure and program that will display the following information about your department:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Tree density of each park (number of trees/park area)</li>
        <li>Average age of each towns park (sum of all the parks / how many parks there are)</li>

        <li>Total length of the towns streets</li>
        <li>Average length of the towns streets</li>
